# From Deception to Learning
**Next-Gen Hybrid Intrusion Detection System**  
High-interaction Honeypot + Continual Learning AI (River)

**Capstone Project 2025 – In Progress**

### Concept
Collect real attacks via a live honeypot → automatically extract features → retrain the ML model online without catastrophic forgetting.

### Current Status
- [x] Cowrie honeypot deployed & logging real attacks
- [ ] Feature extraction pipeline
- [ ] Continual learning model (River)
- [ ] Auto-retraining loop

### Tech Stack
- Python
- River (online/continual ML)
- Cowrie Honeypot
- Docker
- ELK Stack

More code, demos & write-up coming very soon…
